Abstract
Recently, in the field of information technology has increased interest in solving problems with methods of artificial 
intelligence. The reason is that the volume and complexity of information had increased, so they cannot be processed with
classical methods. One of the widely used areas of artificial intelligence is expert systems (ES) â€“ programs, which can partially
replace a specialist expert in resolving problematic situations. The architecture of any ES includes a clearly defined set of
modules that allows you to develop a shell for creating ES. The most common structure of the modules of the expert system is
tabular forms. But they have several disadvantages which can be eliminated by using graphs. This project describes the design 
of the shell for analytical ES with graph-structure modules.
